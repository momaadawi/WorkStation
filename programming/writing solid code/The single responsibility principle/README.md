After understanding **Single Responsibility** you will be able to :
* Understand the importance of the single responsibility principle.
* Identify classes that have too many responsibilities. 
* Refactor monolithic classes into smaller classes with single responsibilitie
* Use design patterns to separate responsibilities

## The single responsibility principle (SRP) :
- instructs developers to write code that has one and only one reason to change.
- If a class has more than one reason to change, 
- If it has more than one responsibility. 
Classes with more than a single responsibility should be broken down into smaller classes,each of which should have only one responsibility and reason to change.
