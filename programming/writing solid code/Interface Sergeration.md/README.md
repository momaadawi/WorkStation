# Interface Sergeraiton
The interface segregation principle states that interfaces should be small
## A Segeration Example


There are plenty of reasons why interfaces should be segregatedâ€”to aid decoration, to correctly
hide functionality from clients, as self-documentation for other developers, or as a side effect of ar-
chitectural design. Whatever the reason, it is a technique that should be kept at the forefront of your
mind whenever you are creating an interface. As with most programming tools, it is easier to start out
on the right path than to go back and heavily refactor.
