A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system
that works. The inverse proposition also appears to be true: **A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be made to work**


The problem with daily batch processes is that changes in the input are only reflected
in the output a day later, which is too slow for many impatient users. To reduce the delay, we can run the processing more frequently — say, processing a second’s worth
of data at the end of every second — or even continuously, abandoning the fixed
time-slices entirely, and simply processing every event as it happens. That is the idea
behind stream processing.

In General Stream refers to : data that is incremeantly made avaliable over time, The concept appears in many places:
- in the stdin and stdout of Unix
- programming languages (lazy lists)
- TCP connections
- delivering audio and video over the internet
