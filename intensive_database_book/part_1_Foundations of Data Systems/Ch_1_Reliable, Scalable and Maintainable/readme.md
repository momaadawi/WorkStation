#### Reliability
    The system should continue to work correctly (performing the correct function at
    the  desired  performance)  even  in  the  face  of  adversity  (hardware  or  software
    faults, and even human error). 
#### Scalability
    As the system grows (in data volume, traffic volume or complexity), there should
    be reasonable ways of dealing with that growth. 

#### Maintainability
    Maintaining  current  behavior  and  adapting  the  system  to  new  use
    cases), and they should all be able to work on it productively.
