### Maintainability

#### three  design  principles  for  software  systems:
* Operability
Make it easy for operations teams to keep the system running smoothly.
* Simplicity
Make it easy for new engineers to understand the system, by removing as much
complexity  as  possible  from  the  system.  (Note  this  is  not  the  same  as  simplicity
of the user interface.)
* Evolvability
Make  it  easy  for  engineers  in  future  to  make  changes  to  the  system,  adapting  it
for unanticipated use cases as requirements change. Also known as extensibility,
modifiability or plasticity.
